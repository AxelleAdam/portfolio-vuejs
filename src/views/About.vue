    <h4>Parcours</h4>
    <h4>Passions</h4>
    <h5>Travels</h5>
    <p>If i had to present my biggest passion, it's probably traveling.</p>
    <h5>Video games</h5>
    <p>
      My father transmitted me his passion for video games and offers me at a
      very young age my first console.
    </p>
    <h5>History</h5>
    <p>I'm a big fan of history, mainly WWII.</p>
    <h4>Languages</h4>
    <h5>French</h5>
    <p><i>fun fact</i></p>
    <p>
      I'm a french person who lived almost her whole life in the North so i also
      speak "ch'ti" !
    </p>
    <h5>English</h5>
    <p>
      My english is far from perfect but i can hold a whole conversation in
      English, my travels helped me a lot for that, probably more than school.
      But I was very good in school and was in Euro English section and English
      Litterature.
    </p>
    <h5>German</h5>
    <p>
      Germany was one of my biggest heartstroke, i traveled in the whole country
      (or almost !) and i'd love to see more.
    </p>
    <h5>Polish</h5>
    <p>
      As you probably have seen, my name is Polish. My great parents are from
      Poland from both sides of my family but none wanted to teach us Polish. So
      when i was in High School, i jumped on the occasion. And the funny part
      was that i was very, very good at it.
    </p>
    <h5>Japanese</h5>
    <p>
      My third languages when i went to High School, I was very curious and I am
      very fascinated by Japan and history.
